============

Behaviour Driven Development Workshop with SpecFlow

Rules:
- Always start with the executable specification before implementing a feature.
- Make small steps. Don't try to write complete specification at once. 



Exercise 1 (Duplicate check with exact match):
- Implement a system that allow you to add a person by entering first- and lastname.
- If there is already a person with the exact same first- and lastname the system deny the entry.
- If no entry with the same name exist the new person is stored to the system.


Exercise 2 (Add date of birth to duplicate check):
- Change the duplicate check that it checks the date of birth beside the first- and lastname


Exercise 3 (Add more examples):
- Refactor Spec to Solution Outline
- Add some more examples


Exercise 4 (Fuzzy Match):
- Add some more example to very Fuzzy Match
- Implement duplicate check with Fuzzy Match

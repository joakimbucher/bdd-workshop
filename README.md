============

Behaviour Driven Development Workshop with SpecFlow

Rules:
- Always start with the executable specification before implemention a feature.
- Make small steps. Don't try to write complete specification at once. 



Exercise 1 (Duplicate check with exact match):
- Implement a system that allow you to add a person by entering first- and lastname.
- If there is already a person with the exact same first- and lastname the system deny the entry.
- If no entry with the same name exist the new person is stored to the system.
